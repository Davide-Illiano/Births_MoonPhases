# Births_MoonPhases
Simple Python code which proves that there is no relation between moon phases and births.

Numerous beleives are related to the moon phases. One of the most famous is the increase of births around the full moons. 
These beleive has clearly no scientific base and this simple code further shows it.

The directory is composd by only two files, an excell file containing all the the numbers daily births, in the USA, from 1992 to 2019.
The births_moon.py is a simple python code which first extract the data from the excell file and then plots them. We have also been able to 
add, thanks to vertical lines, the dates of full moons. 
It is clearly observable that the number of births per day appears to be random and no relation can be found with the phases of the moon.
